## Encrypter.app

A simple GUI for the 'openssl enc' shell command that I wrote when I was little to hide "secret stuff" from my brothers.

## iPhysics.app

Awesome little app for hacking my boring physics homework in high school. Calculates velocities, acceleration, time and distance based on given terms. It also has a "Show Work" function. I think I learned the formulae better making this app then I would have doing repetitive problems by hand. Unfortunately I can't find the source code.

## Area Converter.app

Convert between the latin american units of land: hectares, acres, manzanas and tareas.
